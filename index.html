    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      Is your student struggling with test anxiety, inconsistent scores, or not sure where to start?
      Topscore Method is a clear, strategic path designed to boost confidence, performance, and real
      SAT and ACT results in math and science.
      At Topscore Method, students have the potential to excel since they are given the right tools,
      the right strategy, and the right support. Developed by expert tutor Judy DaCosta, PhD, the
      proprietary method follows both the SAT and ACT tests closely, diagnoses student
      misunderstandings and weaknesses, and rebuilds confidence through targeted practice, custom
      hints and strategies, and refined repetition.
      This is NOT tutoring off the shelf. This is tutoring that works because it is built around why
      students struggle, and how they succeed. It is an individualized program with mindset coaching
      to unlock each student’s full potential.
      The result? A smarter way to prepare, and scores that reflect it.
