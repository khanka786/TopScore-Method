        I can't say enough good things about my experience working with Judy! When I started studying for the SAT, the math section felt so overwhelming and confusing. Judy quickly identified my weak areas and helped me target them with focused practice and strategies. She always helped me understand the steps to solve each problem, not just how to get the right answer. Judy knows so much about the SAT and helped me focus on the types of questions that are common on the test. After a few months of working with Judy, I felt fully prepared to take the SAT.<br><br>
        Thanks to Judy, I was able to improve my score by 270 points from my first practice test and get a nearly perfect math score on the SAT! I would highly recommend Judy to anyone looking to improve their score and feel more confident on the test. Judy was beyond helpful, and I'm so grateful I got to work with her!

        Highly recommend Judy as a Math tutor and SAT/ACT prep tutor, she is highly knowledgeable at all subjects, she was able to teach my three children and was able to adapt to each child needs. She brought their scores high and we were extremely satisfied with the results. She is kind, sincere, accommodating and over all a pleasure to work with.<br><br>
