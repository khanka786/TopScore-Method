        <h2>About Judy DaCosta, PhD</h2>
        <p>With over 16 years of experience as a private tutor, I’ve helped hundreds of students achieve top
        scores on the SAT and ACT—many earning spots in competitive programs and scholarships. I
        specialize in SAT Math, ACT Math, and ACT Science, and I closely follow changes to each
        exam to ensure my students are always working with the most current strategies and information.</p>

        <p>I hold a Ph.D. from the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (now part of
        Rutgers University), and I bring the precision and analytical thinking from my academic
        background into every session. My data-driven approach includes detailed diagnostics, targeted
        skill-building, and personalized performance coaching—down to estimating the percent
        probability of seeing specific question types on test day.</p>

        <p>Just as important as what I teach is how I teach. I’m known for explaining concepts in multiple
        ways until they truly click. Students find me approachable, patient, and easy to work with—and
        they’re comfortable asking questions, which leads to deeper understanding and stronger
        performance.</p>

        <p>If you’re looking for elite guidance, proven results, and a tutor who meets students where they
        are, you’re in the right place.</p>
