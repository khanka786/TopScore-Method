        I can't say enough good things about my experience working with Judy! When I started studying for the SAT, the math section felt so overwhelming and confusing. Judy quickly identified my weak areas and helped me target them with focused practice and strategies. She always helped me understand the steps to solve each problem, not just how to get the right answer. Judy knows so much about the SAT and helped me focus on the types of questions that are common on the test. After a few months of working with Judy, I felt fully prepared to take the SAT.<br><br>
        Thanks to Judy, I was able to improve my score by 270 points from my first practice test and get a nearly perfect math score on the SAT! I would highly recommend Judy to anyone looking to improve their score and feel more confident on the test. Judy was beyond helpful, and I'm so grateful I got to work with her!

        Highly recommend Judy as a Math tutor and SAT/ACT prep tutor, she is highly knowledgeable at all subjects, she was able to teach my three children and was able to adapt to each child needs. She brought their scores high and we were extremely satisfied with the results. She is kind, sincere, accommodating and over all a pleasure to work with.<br><br>
        Thank you

        I can’t say enough wonderful things about Judy.
        My first child met with her 4 times and his ACT math score went up NINE POINTS!
        My second child deeply struggles with math especially because he moved to American school in
        10th grade from French school which is a completely different curriculum. Judy worked directly with his
        teachers (even getting one to change a test she was planning to give!) and she really taught Will over 2.5
        years. He would never have made it through math at Pali without her. And he loves her. He wanted to
        invite her to join his graduation. Tough to get a kid to love a tutor for a subject he hates and it is really a
        testament to Judy.
        This family shouts from the rooftops endorsements for Judy. Highly recommend!

        Seven years ago, I began the daunting task of preparing for the ACT. Once I started working with Judy, the process no longer felt overwhelming. Judy went above and beyond, creating her own resources to clearly explain difficult mathematical concepts, in addition to providing extensive ACT prep materials. After a few sessions with Judy, I was consistently hitting my target score on practice tests, which ultimately translated into my actual performance. Judy's ability to personalize each session and focus on high-yield content is the reason why I earned a 36.<br><br>
        When my brother began studying for the ACT last year, we did not have to think twice and immediately turned to Judy.

        Once I started my ACT prep, Judy and I worked very closely, allowing me to achieve my target score. Judy did an exceptional job at explaining hard concepts step by step and making sure that I never got the same problem wrong twice. It is evident that she has a true passion for teaching and is the best tutor I have worked with.

        Thanks to Judy, I achieved an SAT math score even I did not believe was possible! I 100% believe this was possible because I had Judy on my side. She taught me test taking SAT tricks, but she also taught me how to understand what the challenging questions were asking, and how to break things down and answer with certainty. If I did not understand a concept, she always made me feel confident that it was within my reach. She always stayed patient. Most of all, she had confidence and believed in me, which made me dedicated to reach the score I got.<br><br>
        There is truly no one like Judy!!!
