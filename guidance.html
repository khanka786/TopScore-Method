        <h2>Test Strategy & Prep</h2>

        <h3>Unsure Whether to Take the SAT or ACT?</h3>
        <p>Choosing the right test is a critical first step in a successful testing strategy. The TOSCORE
        Method Diagnostic Assessment provides a comprehensive analysis of the student’s performance
        patterns, academic strengths, and cognitive style to determine which exam offers the greatest
        advantage.</p>
        <p>Make an informed, data-driven decision.<br>
        Schedule your diagnostic today and receive expert guidance on the optimal path forward—
        saving time, reducing stress, and setting the foundation for peak performance.</p>
        

        <h3>PSAT Prep with the TOPSCORE Method</h3>
        <p>Laying the foundation for future success—strategically and confidently.</p>
        <p>The PSAT isn’t just a practice SAT—it's the first major step in a student’s college admissions
        journey. Strong PSAT scores can lead to National Merit recognition and valuable scholarship
        opportunities, as well as build confidence for the SAT or ACT.</p>
        <p>At TOPSCORE Method, we approach PSAT preparation with the same precision and strategy
        we bring to SAT and ACT prep. Students receive:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A targeted diagnostic to identify strengths and gaps early</li>
            <li>Proprietary skill-building materials tailored to their needs</li>
            <li>Test-day mindset coaching to build confidence from the start</li>
            <li>Guidance on PSAT vs. SAT vs. ACT, including percent probability of question types and optimal timing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our PSAT program doesn’t just prepare students for a single test—it sets the tone for high
        performance across their entire college admissions timeline.</p>
        <p>Start early. Start strong. Let TOPSCORE Method guide the way.</p>

        <h2>Student Responsibility</h2>
        <p><strong>TOPSCORE Method delivers results</strong>—but success requires commitment.</p>

        <p><strong>TOPSCORE</strong> is a proven, high-performance system—but it is not magic. Meaningful score increases come from a true partnership between tutor and student. To get the most out of this program, students must:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Complete all assigned homework thoroughly and on time, using the strategies and notes provided during sessions.</li>
            <li>Engage actively during tutoring sessions, asking questions and taking ownership of their learning.</li>
            <li>Take the process seriously, treating preparation with the same level of importance as a high-stakes academic course.</li>
            <li>Review mistakes thoughtfully—not just for correctness, but to understand the <em>why</em> behind each error.</li>
            <li>Practice consistently outside of sessions to reinforce skills and build the stamina needed for high-stakes testing.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Our most successful students are those who show up prepared, put in the work, and trust the process. When they do, the results speak for themselves.</p>
