        <h3>PSAT Prep with the TOPSCORE Method</h3>
        <p>Laying the foundation for future success—strategically and confidently.</p>
        <p>The PSAT isn’t just a practice SAT—it's the first major step in a student’s college admissions
        journey. Strong PSAT scores can lead to National Merit recognition and valuable scholarship
        opportunities, as well as build confidence for the SAT or ACT.</p>

        we bring to SAT and ACT prep. Students receive:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A targeted diagnostic to identify strengths and gaps early</li>
            <li>Proprietary skill-building materials tailored to their needs</li>
            <li>Test-day mindset coaching to build confidence from the start</li>
            <li>Guidance on PSAT vs. SAT vs. ACT, including percent probability of question types and optimal timing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our PSAT program doesn’t just prepare students for a single test—it sets the tone for high
        performance across their entire college admissions timeline.</p>
